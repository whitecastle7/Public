The manager of this repo is primarily french-speaking
and as such any work included is best seen if you can read french.

In short, this repo contains some work that could be used
to help assure the manager's capacity to write code.

Each project will have a short description of what the code should do,
in what condition it was written
as well as how viable it would be to run it.
