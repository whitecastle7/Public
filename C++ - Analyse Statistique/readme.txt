Statistic Analysis
C++ (with a precompiled library)

The program itself is very short.
The code in the precompiled library was not made available.
The do_process() function is called, everything else is the coder's job.

The goal is simple:
Randomly, vectors containing Reels and Integers are sent out.
Some are actually empty, some have only zeros, others have ascending numbers
and some have completely random values.
In the shortest amount of time, values for the sum, median, average
and other calculations must be sent back through a set() function.

All of the values sent must obviously be correct.
