Project Name:					Quiz images-country


Programming Language:			Java (Swing, Apache POI)


How to run:						This program was made in an Eclipse workspace 
							and may have problem running in other environement.


Notes:							The Apache POI library did cause non-fatal errors/warnings.
							A database was supposed to be implimented
							but due to constraints (covid, time) an Excel-based import was made.

							This small program is considered unfinished and will not be retouched.
							It nevertheless has a few valuable aspects in regards to the code itself.


The program:					At first, this program asks the user for a difficulty setting
							(which is not implimented, aside from the choice).

							The program then presents the user with a picture,
							a short description of said picture,
							as well as a list of countries to select from.
							The user must then select the country associated with the image.
							A point system is implimented.

							Due to contrainsts (covid, time), the amount countries, images,
							as well as their descriptions is absurdly short.


Additional Notes:				The goal was not to make a full-fledged program (due to covid),
							but rather to have an exercice in coding,
							by applying not only good practices,
							but also adding new elements that the coder had not seen or made before.
							For exemple, having an event-handler not embeded within a super class,
							while still respecting OOP encapsulation.
